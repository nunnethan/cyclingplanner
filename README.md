# Cycling Planner
A cycling planning app written in SwiftUI

## Next thing to do
Migrate setup and Mapbox tiles to SwiftUI. May require a UIKit wrapper for Mapbox component.

## Current features
UK wide map showing cycle routes. Simple routing algorithm to determine routes along these paths. Weighting for paths more suited to cycling.
## Possible  features
Restoreable from iCloud and Health and Activity on Apple Watch synchronisation. 3D view when cycling Ã  la Apple Maps
## Licence and misc.
This work is MIT licenced. Do what you want but do not expect support.
Because of the nature of this project I am unable to accept pull requests.
